The header files in this folder are intended for use with PASM, the PureC
assembler, and also rely on my STNGPASM macro collection which is available
on the STinG homepage. (You need that package for these API macros to work.)

Due to bugs discovered in PASM, I have switched to DevPac for most of my
assembly projects, and no longer develop the STNGPASM macros further.
But I will keep updating these header files as needed, since some others
may need them.
