The header files in this folder are intended for use with DevPac 3, and also
rely on my STNGDEVP macro collection which is available on the STinG homepage.
(You need that package for these API macros to work.)

That package is what I use for most of my software development, so it has
not only macros for STinG support, but contains extensive support for most
system features available to Atari computers.

It is under constant development, and will so remain...
