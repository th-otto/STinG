The header files in this folder (currently only TRANSPRT.H) are primarily
intended for use with 'Gnu C' version 2.8.1, with which they have been
tested.  They differ from older versions in that STinG calls will be
compiled properly even when the default 'int' size of GCC is 'long'.

As yet this has only been used for the STinG network routines of the DOOM
engine developed by Patrice Mandin (version 0.25 and later), so it is
possible that some 'typos' and/or other bugs remain which I have missed.
Please contact me if you find any such. (Contact info is in STING.HYP)

You should also contact me if you need other STING header files fixed for
GCC compatibility.  At present PureC is the main compiler for STinG, and
therefore I do not need GCC headers for STinG module development yet.
