SNTP.PRG
========

SNTP is a simple NTP client for Atari-TOS. It currently
supports MiNTNet and STinG TCP/IP stacks.

When running it, make sure that the correct timezone offset is used.
For STinG, this setting is taken from DEFAULT.CFG (entries TIME_ZONE &
TIME_SUMMER). When running under MiNT, this should normally be
auto-detected, provided that you installed the correct timezone file as
/etc/localtime, and tzinit has been run to initialize the kernels idea
of a local time.

Should that not be the case, you can change the entry manually.
Note that this is rather important to get a correct system time,
since servers only provide GMT times.

You can test your settings by deselecting the Update-System-time
button, and then start a query. In the box below it, you will see both
the GMT time as send by the server, as well as the local time which
would be set.
