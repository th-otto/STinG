 Since a dialog by mail is very slow,  some users

 by phone, using the phone number below:

        08 - 53184105

 The first two digits are the area code for Stockholm,
 so foreign callers must remove the leading zero.
 (And of course start by dialling Sweden.)

Introduction to Cen_PLIP                                             Cen_PLIP
@line 1 77 0 0 7

Cen_PLIP.Stx is a STinG module which implements a  PLIP port compatible to
those used with  MintNet. (For which PLIP was invented.)  This now gives a
normal  ST  the possibility of using  much higher transfer speed for local
networking, thanks to the use of a parallel port.

The name of this port is "Centr. PLIP", and it is these 11 characters that
you must enter as 'port name' in  ROUTE.TAB to configure routes for  PLIP.
The name was chosen to remain unique if other PLIP drivers for other ports
are created, or if other drivers are made for the centronics port.

The effective speed is limited by other factors of course, so having a lot
of servers and clients constantly active may lower this efficiency, but no
port can be immune to this effect.  The STinG timeslice also affects the
rate at which packets are handed to clients, and thus the overall speed.

Using PLIP to connect my STE via my Mega ST (using Masque.Stx) to internet,
both machines supply their clients with data at  virtually the same speed.
The speed limit then is actually set by the modem, since PLIP is very much
faster than the 14K4 modem I have.

The full speed of  PLIP will only be utilized when using a direct network,
so that no modem imposes a lowered speed limit on any transfers.  Even an
unaccelerated ST will achieve  TCP  rates in excess of 4500 cps, and even
higher rates for simpler protocols.

To me, this makes local networking truly enjoyable, to a degree that could
never quite be matched using Midi, which is what I had to use before.  The
many  musicians that use  Ataris  should also welcome the ability to use a
fast networking port which does not interfere with their  Midi  equipment.

The necessary connections:
--------------------------

Essentially a PLIP cable is an RS232 cable with some lines unconnected, and
one pair of lines crossed (like in a null-modem).  Only 11 lines need to be
used, since lines 18-24 are duplicate ground lines.  I recommend using them
too, to minimize grounding problems, but that is up to you.

The necessary connections are specified as one connecting line per character
row in the diagram below:

            DB-25                   DB-25
            Unit A                  Unit B
        ---------------         ---------------
          pin   name              pin   name
          ---   ----              ---   ----
           1    STROBE             11   BUSY
           2    D0                  2   D0
           3    D1                  3   D1
           4    D2                  4   D2
           5    D3                  5   D3
           6    D4                  6   D4
           7    D5                  7   D5
           8    D6                  8   D6
           9    D7                  9   D7
          11    BUSY                1   STROBE
          25    GROUND             25   GROUND

Pins 12-17 should be unconnected, and pins 18-24 are extra grounds.

As you can see from the tables  above,  it is a very simple matter to make a
PLIP cable from a leftover RS232 flat-cable.  Just cut away lines 12 to 17
completely and simply cut lines 1 and 11 so you can cross connect them.
(Splice them with some of the surplus wire from lines 12 to 17 just removed)

NB: Remember that DB-25 connectors do *NOT* number the pins in the same
    order that they appear on a flat cable. The numbers given are all DB-25!
    So pins 1 and 2 are not adjacent in the cable, but have pin 14 between.

Important !!!  The lines to cut away are thus *NOT* a block of adjacent ones.


This was the easy way !  Now for the *BETTER* way.

Keep you RS232 cable intact and make a small adapter from two leftover DB-25
connectors instead.   This also gives you the opportunity to add  protection
for the main port driving chip (The PSG of your computer).  This helps avoid
damage when both ports are set as outputs with the cable connected.

NB:  This happens *EVERY* time both computers are switched on, or reset.

This protection simply consists of low value (not too low) resistors, placed
in series with each of the data lines.  I used 75 Ohm resistors.  If you use
lower resistors,  the protection is decreased,  but using much higher values
will interfere with signal transfer levels.  I advice 50-100 Ohms as limits.

The resistors together with normal circuit capacitance also form lowpass pi-
filters that help eliminate signal reflection and 'ringing',  to keep signal
logic levels reliable.

Regardless of which method you use,  do be  careful  to avoid shortcircuits,
and make sure everything gets properly isolated.   Any  damage you may cause
is your own responsibility, and since the PSG fills many important functions
(not just sound) in the computer, your system will not work without it.

I have myself let the cable remain connected  since I completed the adapter,
but you must choose what to do for yourself.  I am not responsible for that.

Installation of Cen_PLIP                                             Cen_PLIP

PLIP.STX must of course be stored in the STinG module folder, with the rest.
Then you need to reboot so that  STinG  loads the new module so that you can
configure it, which is done in the usual way with STNGPORT.CPX

PLIP is a very simple protocol, identical to pure SLIP,  with the difference
of using a  parallel interface rather than a  serial one.   Because it is so
simple there is no need to configure anything  else than the  IP number, the
MTU size, and the activation flag.

To actually make  use of the port,  you must of course also edit your  route
file  ROUTE.TAB, to include at least one entry for the port  "Centr. PLIP".

For a  'slave' unit that needs to access a  'master' unit over PLIP so as to
get  indirect access to  internet (requires Masque.Stx), you do not need any
other entries than the one for  PLIP, which should then have  0.0.0.0 in all
the IP number/network fields.  Like this:

0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0         Centr. PLIP     0.0.0.0

For the master unit the "Centr. PLIP" entry needs to be a small subnet spec,
and could look like this:

1.0.255.0       255.255.255.0   Centr. PLIP     0.0.0.0

Remember that this line must come before the default route, used for the
internet connection, since the file may not be processed below that line.


There are two things which are noteworthy of the last example above:

1:  That network uses addresses which will not be used by internet.
    This means there can never be any conflict.

2:  You will need to use an IP address of the form 1.0.255.xxx  for any
    machine to be reached through this subnet entry.  This particularly
    includes the "PLIP" port of the  'slave'  unit, and it is advisable
    to use a related number for that on the  'Master'  unit too.

 1.07           1998 February 12
                After 48 hours nearly continuous work at speed optimization
                this version has now achieved bulk transfer rates averaging
                at 6100 cps (equivalent to serial 61000 bps), when browsing
                from a 16 MHz Mega ST4 running CAB 2.7 + CAB.OVL 1.2805 to
                access pages/files on a 16 MHz falcon running SHTTPD 2.2.
                This is good enough to release, though I still expect more!


 1.06           1998 February 10
                After some necessary STinG Kernel improvements last November
                the PLIP module lost all reliability.  It has been a long
                struggle to get it back online, but here it is, the first
                Cen_PLIP version running perfectly under the latest STinG.
                This was achieved at cost of speed though, so this version
                is not released.  Who wants PLIP at 1000 cps...?  :-(

 1.05           1997 October 25
                Added module basepage pointer to DRIVER structure.
                This is a new standard defined to ease debugging.


 1.04           1997 October 13
                Rewritten to use a new form of interupt masking, to improve
                transfer rates and decrease errors due to kernel interrupts
                interfering with PLIP timing.

                Renamed to "Centr. PLIP" with filename "CEN_PLIP.STX", after
                long discussions with Peter on naming conventions. This will
                not collide with any future port.


 1.03           1997 September 13
                Rewritten to take advantage of the new capabilities of the
                latest STinG kernel to allow kernel routines to be called
                from hardware interrupts.  This removes an unpleasant limit
                on the number of packets tranferred per timeslice.  Even an
                unspeeded ST can expect TCP rates in excess of 4500 cps now.
                (Tested with MTU=576, MSS=536. Higher values = higher speed)

 1.02           1997 August 25
                A bug that sometimes locked up the system has been killed.
                This is the first proper release version, and test runs on
                it include bidirectional 'Pinging' of 4500 datagrams.
        NB:     No tests have yet been made with 'partners' using MintNet,
                so reports on results with such would be appreciated.

 1.01           1997 August 22
                The fatal bug mentioned below has been exterminated.
                The statistics counter for dropped packets is corrected.
                Statistics counters for sent/received data are implemented.
                The document is now in ST-Guide hypertext format.

 1.00           1997 August 22
                First functional version, with one FATAL bug that could
                kill unrelated MFP interrupts...

 0.xx           1997 August 18-21
                Project start and various experiments
