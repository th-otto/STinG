Still to do
=========================================================================
Has been done
     \/


V1.15  Public version to go out with STinG 1.12
-----------------------------------------------

   - New option CIX_LOGIN (CompuServe style) logs in using 7E1.

   - Implemented display of connection (DCE) speed.

   - New procedure for passing PPP accounting information to SERIAL.STX.

   - Partial implementation of network environment.  Still lacks ability
      to edit the environment strings.

   - Various bugfixes.


V1.12  Public version to go out with STinG 1.08
-----------------------------------------------

   - Sends ESC now if '\' is last character in RESP, for Kerstin.

   - Implemented logging of connection initialisation.

   - Revamped connection procedure to comprise the actual initialisation
      of PPP too.

   - Several minor bugs fixed.

   - Extended length of PAP_ID and PAP_Password for Deutsche Telekom users.

   - Display of Routing Table by a new Tool implemented.

   - Manipulation of routing table implemented.


V1.10  Public version to go out with STinG 1.06
-----------------------------------------------

   - Implemented PAP variables.

   - Implemented handling of IP masquerading.


V1.02  First public version to go out with STinG 1.00
-----------------------------------------------------

   - Some minor bugfixes.


V0.98  Beta version
-------------------

   - Trace route shows domain names now.

   - Several improvements to the GUI.  Complete 3D look now.

   - Fixed flicker effects in some displays.

   - Establishes connections for STinG now.


V0.95  Beta version, rewritten for STinG
----------------------------------------

   - Launching login tools, using LOGIN_BATCH, implemented.

   - Remote controlled operation via UDP implemented.

   - STinG datagram statistics display implemented.

   - Implemented trace route tool.  Not showing domain names yet.

   - Implemented complete ping tool.


V0.90  Beta version, probably the last beta before release.
-----------------------------------------------------------

   - A few minor bugs fixed.  It's getting very stable.


V0.85  Beta version, for all beta testers.
------------------------------------------

   - Several cosmetic corrections on the resource file.

   - Hang-up inquiry on leaving the Dialer removed.

   - A timeout mechanism for the script FIND has been introduced, in order
      to handle bad connections, or bad modems at the other end.

   - New precision usage of evnt_timer ensures precise timing of the
      dialing thread.

   - Responds to VA_START by activation of main window, just like AC_OPEN.

   - AC_CLOSE, AP_TERM and AP_RESCHG are handled even in sleep mode now.

   - More successful bug hunts ...


V0.80  Beta version, for all beta testers.
------------------------------------------

   - Whenever STiK already uses a chosen port (either in DIAL.SCR at
      startup time or changed in CONFIG later) this will be recognized.

   - A dial script editor has been included into the CONFIG section.

   - Additional variable 'RESIDENT' determines if the Dialer stays
      resident after the last window has been closed.  Reactivation by
      AC_OPEN.  Only usable on systems with AES multitasking.

   - Additional line in *.LOG gives the total connecton time and the cost
      due to the connection.  For the structure of the *.FEE file refer to 
      the file FEE.DOC.

   - Another line shows amount of transferred data, and the cost charged
      by your ISP due to connection time and transferred data.

   - Several bugs fixed.


V0.76  Beta version, for all beta testers.
------------------------------------------

   - The Dialer can do remote controled dialing and hangup now.  Look at
      the file DIALCTRL.C from the STiK developers kit to see how it's
      done properly.

   - Implemented 'Resolve' tool for resolving mnemonic host names into
      IP addresses.

   - The Dialer writes a *.LOG file, so that the user can keep track of 
      each individual call.

   - Rewrote reaction to locked ports.  The Dialer recognizes now if STiK
      is connected already and shows corresponding buttons.  Thus the
      Dialer can be used to shut down connections now.  Incomplete.

   - Name of file containing the STiK path corrected : now STIK_DIR.DAT,
      not STIK_DIR.INF

   - Searches for STIK_DIR.DAT in more directories.  In sequence :
       * The directory the Dialer has been started from
       * The root directory of the drive the Dialer has been started from
       * The root directory of the boot drive
      It assumes \STIK_CFG\ as STiKs directory if STIK_DIR.DAT can't be 
      found.


V0.70  Beta version, for all beta testers.
------------------------------------------

   - Tools 'Ping', 'Resolve' and 'Trace Route' show some sensible
      reaktion upon user activation (report that not implemented yet).

   - Tool 'Show Memory' upgraded to show STiK internal, ST RAM and
      alternate RAM, both largest block and total amount.

   - Added setting of the line protocol (SLIP, CSLIP) internal variable.
   
   - Quite a few bugs fixed.


V0.55  Alpha version turned Beta version, just for Dan.
-------------------------------------------------------

   - Set all significant parameters for STiK, and pass connection to
      STiK. Thus useful now.


V0.50  The first version to be spread throughout all STiK beta testers.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

   - New script variable 'REPT' introduced, for dial-in to some rather 
      weird Internet service providers that require being triggered.

   - New dial success string 'DIRECT' for starting up non-modem (direct) 
      connections.

   - The user can choose the serial port and port speed now inside the 
      dialer.  Like in original STiK the availability of the Carrier
      Detect signal is up to the user.

   - Replaced own rudimentary serial functions by Jan Kriestens DEVICE-
      LIB.  Other ports than Modem 1 should not cause problems anymore.

   - Finished making the WINDOW library support foreign AES messages.
      As a consequence, AC_CLOSE, AP_TERM and AP_RESCHG are handled 
      properly now.

   - Windows can now be iconified.  This does not hinder normal operation,
      so an iconified "Dialing" window continues the dialing process.

   - Adjusted TCP Parameters to the ones used in STiK now (removed MSS, 
      DFB_SIZE, PKT_SIZE, added PROTOCOL).

   - Machines using rather low resolutions like 320 x 200 won't have 
      problems anymore, 'cos windows containing rather large forms grow 
      sliders now.

   - Evil bug in the script interpreter chased down and killed.  Thanks 
      Flinny !


V0.23  Very first version to be released to just very few people.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

   - Very basic version of the dialer, capable of very little.  Just to 
      demonstrate how it's going to be done.
