#
#  This is the routing table, to be used by the router to route IP datagrams
#
#  Format of routes comprises four entries, separated by TABs :
#    - First the network (subnet number) which can be reached by using this
#       route.
#    - Next the subnet mask associated with that network.
#    - Then the port name follows. This is the name as listed by ConfSTinG or
#       STNGPORT.CPX.
#    - Last entry is the IP address of a host on the attached network that 
#       can act as a gateway.
#
#  The network specified can be directly attached to the specified port, in
#  that case no gateway is needed, as the datagram can be routed directly.
#  For a route to a network that is directly attached therefore the gateway 
#  entry should be set to 0.0.0.0.
#
#  For an attached Ethernet the gateway entry specifies the gateway out of 
#  the Ethernet, for a serial line it is simply the host at the other end.
#
#  It is advisable to finish the table by a default route. This route is most
#  easily obtained by specifying a network 0.0.0.0 with a netmask 0.0.0.0.
#
#  Routes with invalid addresses or absent ports are ignored.
#
# 192.68.0.0		255.255.255.240		Modem 1		192.68.0.1
# 130.75.75.0		255.255.255.128		Ser.2/LAN	0.0.0.0
# 0.0.0.0		0.0.0.0			Ser.2/LAN	130.75.75.16
#
0.0.0.0		0.0.0.0		Modem 1		0.0.0.0
