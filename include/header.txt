
This directory is for the programmers. For client programming, you never
need the PORT.H and LAYER.H. You only need the TRANSPRT.H, which replaces 
*both* TRANSPRT.H and DRIVERS.H from old STiK. Please try to compile your
client with the new TRANSPRT.H, you should not need to change your source 
code. If the compiler throws about more errors or warnings, please tell 
me about it. Best : Send me the file the compiler did store the error and
warnings, with an excerpt of your source code.

PORT.H and LAYER.H are for STX programming only. You'll need PORT.H with
TRANSPRT.H if you wanna write a port STX, like the SERIAL, MIDI, or ETHER.
If you wanna start any such project, please contact me, I'll provide more
info on it. LAYER.H together with TRANSPRT.H form the basis for a high 
level protocol STX. In future possibly there will be a Internet phone
protocol STX. Again, contact me if you wanna start on a similar thing.

These header files are written for use with Pure C. Other compilers might
need slight adjustments. Try to #include the file 'portab.h' before the
actual #include's for the other header files. If that still gives you 
problems with your compiler, contact me.


Keep hacking ;-)
