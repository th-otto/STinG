# STiNG TCP/IP stack for Atari computers running TOS

This is the source of the version 1.26 of the STinG
drivers and utilties, originally developed by
Peter Rottengatter and later enhanced by Ulf Ronald Andersson.

The sources in this branch have been reorganized and cleaned
up a bit, with a few obvious bug fixes, but no major
enhancements. They are primary of historic interest, there
is no major development planned.

Original sources, as found in the 1.20 version and updated
to version 1.26, can be found on the [original branch](https://github.com/th-otto/STinG/tree/orig).
