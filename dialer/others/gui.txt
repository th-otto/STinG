     I'm working on revamping STiK almost completely.  Would you be
interested in working on a new dialer utility.  In the new version this
will have nothing to do with the internals of STiK.  Sorry badly worded
sentence there. Here is a rough illustration of the new design on the
table.


     1. STIK TSR program

          Initializes and loads extensions.  Core IP stack.

     2. STiK Extensions

          OVL type files with extra commands/routines for use with STiK.
     The user will be able to select which extensions he or she wishes to
     use.  ex. SMTP,NNTP,FTPD etc

     3. Client Applications

          Everything else.  CAB,Antmail,MGFTP,etc. Including the Dialer.
     STiK will have a connect and disconnect command inside it so the
     dialer (or any application) will just be able to call this.  It would
     also be useful for setting the dial.scr to use or for changing some
     of the settings dynamically.


     Let me know what you think.

     Dan
